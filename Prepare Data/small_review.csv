The time he has spent here has been very productive and working with him educational and enjoyable. I hope not to need him again (though this is highly unlikely) but knowing he is there if I do is very nice.

Well, after 10 seconds they fixed the problem. As the owner of a company that does our best numbers over the holiday season, having my phone out of order for 4.5 hours was horrible. Sharpie Tech fixed the problem in record time, even Verizon was shocked. I highly recommend working with this company and I look forward to working with them more.

I found some other small decor items. Price was fair and they delivered today.  Shawn did a great job. Keep up the good work! I will definitely be back.,2LfIuF3_sX6uwe-IR-P0jQ,5,2014-07-14,0,review,1

They have similar items to their neighbors Modern Manor, but not the ""designer"" prices.  We got a green vintage chair for $98 and just are having the skirt around the bottom removed to show the great legs on it.

I called yesterday asking if they has something we need and minutes later I was text numerous pictures.  Because of the excellent staff, I will be going up there today.

0,A_Hyfk3FcwFVIk1CQC7z7w,MvvT0BtQH9wq7K-pPgkoEQ,"Disappointing.  I've been there twice hoping that a re-return would change my original opinion.  The first time I was there was on a Saturday, early afternoon in Spring.  I found it strange that I was the only one in the store for about 20 minutes, until another customer came in.  Melrose is usually a pretty happening place during the Spring before summer temps hit.  I saw a lot of nice 1960s furniture, mostly living room sets and home decor.  Prices were on the high end for, let's face it folks, used furniture. The blonde lady who came out to greet me after I made it to their second room (there are 3 rooms total) was frazzled and preoccupied with eating her lunch. So I went back again last week.  Didn't see the frazzled lady from before but a mid-age hipster guy at the counter who didn't have the time to greet me (sorry I disrupted your cell phone surfing).  Yep.  I was the ONLY person in the store and you obviously ignored me.  

It's just an unwelcoming place.  So much potential, but the attitude there is less than acceptable.  Will spend my $$$ elsewhere.",2LfIuF3_sX6uwe-IR-P0jQ,1,2014-07-08,1,review,0

After listing and selling a few of these COOL homes I decided that I should be more familiar with a few MCM furniture shops that I could buy or lease a higher quality furniture. 

After going in a bunch of places I can say that I really love this store and cant wait to use them to stage my newest listing in a few months at 24th and Indian School.

Let me know if you need help finding a cool house with character to put your amazing finds from Modern on Melrose.

Enjoy

0,5NDk-q5mv8PIDvz83HwMVg,l-yhe0IFJ7WTgEk0qD8yqA,"Modern on Melrose is one of our favorite shops on La Curva. It is on the pricey side (of an already pricey shopping experience) but I've had great success for two reasons:

First, the service has been excellent and friendly. We're new to the mcm scene and didn't get snubbed at for not being ""in the know"" -- sadly, this was a welcome relief. 

Second, the selection is good. Yeah, it's always a hunt, but at MOM you aren't going to be sifting through, basically, garbage to find your treasures. With most of the weeding done for you, the store is a much nicer visit.",2LfIuF3_sX6uwe-IR-P0jQ,4,2015-01-13,0,review,0
0,AziQIgYIAY6uVw1k8sbtTw,cNA3oGTmmeRvt10vrvlJOQ,Walked into the store and stuck up a conversation with Shawn behind the counter. We talked about some furniture and other ideas I had for the home. I told him I needed a custom made shelf. Shawn asked some questions and then he sketched out a concept. I loved it. He then said Modern on Melrose has a man that does custom metal work. Three days later-it was done and it turned out better than I could have ever imagined.,2LfIuF3_sX6uwe-IR-P0jQ,5,2014-08-05,1,review,0
0,A65IYKs3FwsyyJH20XOk2w,S_Z5aqlpTVkR9RmYvcPpTQ,"What a lovely place. My boyfriend and I went along with my parents (who love mid century modern furniture) just to look as I am moving soon and can't buy any furniture until I relocate, but this shop made me want to move to downtown Phoenix and fill my house with everything in this shop. My thrift-genius parents taught me to buy antique furniture and never ever ever buy new, as new furniture is expensive to buy and cheaply made. Modern on Melrose is fantastic proof of this - my boyfriend fell in love with a yellow leather and wood 70s couch and noticed that this beautiful couch cost less than a couch our friend recently bought at IKEA. And no one is going to buy IKEA couches in antique stores 40 years from now, because they barely last 1 move. 

Everything in this store is gorgeous and there is a great variety of furniture and random decor goods. We ended up buying some great stacking canisters as a gift, and the very helpful employee dashed back to the area we got them and told us they were 40% off. We debated keeping the canisters because they were as affordable as they were quirky and useful and interestingly designed, but the Christmas spirit prevailed and we decided to give them to their original recipient.

The same employee discussed style and furniture things with my father in a very helpful and absolutely non pretentious way, which is a refreshing and fun element of any antique store. I always want to talk to the employees but very often feel they are too busy or want to sound smarter than me (which they are, but I'm not buying anything if the person I'm giving money to makes me feel stupid). I was very struck by how open and helpful the employee was. Great experience. Great selection. Great prices.",2LfIuF3_sX6uwe-IR-P0jQ,5,2014-12-22,0,review,1
3,wnzfuir72IZFg5RAPOwWCQ,klVqdjXPM2aM8Y0RsDCPoA,"Unfortunately, Yelp does not allow negative stars. I was very much looking forward to going to Modern on Melrose as my sister had raved about the selection and several purchases she recently made here. I was all set to help her select more furniture for her new home until I experienced a combination of disbelief, shock and horror. 

I was inside the store when I heard a man loudly say ""If you're going to start a sale, finish it!"" It took a few more seconds of loud voices before I realized an argument was taking place between two employees and not two customers, as I initially thought. The male and female employee continued to loudly argue, back and forth. Feeling very uncomfortable, I started to look for my sister. There were about four other customers and we all ended up outside as we all felt very uncomfortable in the store. 

As I was walking out of the store to go out back, I heard the male employee say, in a tone that was beyond anger but instead violent, ""Don't you ever tell me to shut up! Ever!"" Shortly after, he walked past all 5 female customers, who had gathered out back, turned to us and angrily said ""Bitch!"" Not knowing what he was going to do when he returned, we decided to leave as we did not feel safe. 

It is one thing to feel uncomfortable, it is completely unacceptable to not feel safe. The interaction between the two employees was the most unprofessional thing I have ever witnessed. The male and female employee were so caught up in their own negative interaction, neither of them offered any customer service. And after their argument ended, the female employee offered no apologies and still no customer service. 

Today was my first and last time in Modern on Melrose. How terribly sad for this store. I sincerely hope the owners get a handle on this and educate their employees as to what it and isn't acceptable behavior.",2LfIuF3_sX6uwe-IR-P0jQ,1,2013-11-17,4,review,2
